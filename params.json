Tim specializes in backend technologies in the Higher Ed and Commercial space helping IntraSee deliver compelling user experiences for PeopleSoft clients.Â \r\n\r\n## Purpose\r\n\r\nTrace Wizard is a Windows Based utility that can assist in making sense of TraceSQL files. \r\n\r\nTrace Wizard strives to provide:\r\n\r\n* Fast processing\r\n* Stable environment (large files shouldn't crash)\r\n* An intuitive understanding of the execution path\r\n * Allows easy viewing of exception/error locations\r\n * Accurate timings throughout the execution path\r\n * Highlights slow calls for ease of performance analysis\r\n* Specific view for Stack Traces\r\n* Memory monitor in bottom-right to track memory usage\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nTrace Wizard requires a Windows OS and the .NET Framework (v4.5), it does not current run well under Mono.\r\n\r\n## Trace File Settings\r\n\r\nThere are certain trace settings that work best with Trace Wizard.\r\n\r\nYou should have the following boxes checked:\r\n\r\n![Trace Settings](images/screenshots/trace_settings.png)\r\n\r\n## Execution Path\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nThe Execution Path view allows you to see the various execution calls that occured and what peoplecode functions / sql statements were called and by whom.\r\n\r\nItems highlighted in Yellow indicate that somewhere in their branch an exception/stack trace/sql error occured, you can follow the yellow trail(s) all the way to the red item.\r\n\r\nItems in red indiciate that they produced an exception/stack trace/sql error, clicking on them should reveal more information in the bottom panel.\r\n\r\n### Searching\r\n\r\nThe execution path view supports searching for function names/line numbers, you can toggle the search box with Ctrl + F, you can also exit out of search with Escape.\r\n\r\n![Exec Path Searching](images/screenshots/ExecPath_Search.png)\r\n\r\n### Performance Monitoring\r\n\r\nThe Execution path is also useful for locating troublesome calls in terms of timing, if a page is slow to load, the proper tracesql and Trace Wizard should make it easy to pinpoint the functions responsible.\r\n\r\n![Highlighting slow calls](images/screenshots/ExecPath_Slow.png)\r\n\r\n## SQL Statements\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nThe SQL Statements view shows every SQL Statement that was found in the trace file.\r\n\r\nDouble clicking on an SQL statement will take you to that exact SQL statement in the Execution Path tab.\r\n\r\n![SQL Statements ALL View](images/screenshots/SQLStatements.png)\r\n\r\n### ALL View\r\n\r\nThe ALL view is the default view and will show each individual SQL statement. Clicking on a statement will show you additional information about it in the lower pane including:\r\n\r\n* The full statement\r\n* Duration of the call\r\n* Time to execute the call\r\n* Time to fetch the results\r\n* Number of rows fetched\r\n* Number of bind variables\r\n* Values for each bind variable.\r\n\r\n### Where View\r\n\r\nDirectly underneath the File menu, there are 3 buttons labelled A/W/F, clicking on the \"A\" button will reset the SQL View tab to displaying the ALL view.\r\n\r\nThe other views provided are the \"WHERE and FROM\" views.\r\n\r\nThe WHERE view groups the SQL statements by unique Where clause and gives aggregate counts for each group as well as total execution time.\r\n\r\n![SQL Where View](images/screenshots/SQLWhere.png)\r\n\r\nDouble clicking one of these items will bring up a pop-up window that contains all of the SQL statements in the group. The information provided on this pop-up is identical to the ALL view.\r\n\r\n![SQL Where View Popup](images/screenshots/SQLWherePopup.png)\r\n\r\nYou can also double click on one of these items to be taken to that specific SQL item in the Execution Path.\r\n\r\n### From View\r\n\r\nThis view is triggered by clicking on the \"F\" button. It operates basically the same to the WHERE view, except it is grouping by FROM statements instead of WHERE\r\n\r\n![SQL From View](images/screenshots/SQLFrom.png)\r\n\r\n### Searching\r\n\r\nThe SQL Statement views supports searching through the SQL Text/line numbers, you can toggle the search box with Ctrl + F, you can also exit out of search with Escape.\r\n\r\n## Stack Trace View\r\n\r\nThis view will show any stack traces that were found in the trace file, again you can click on these for more information or double click to be taken to the location in the execution path where it occurred.","google":"UA-47231707-5","note":"Don't delete this file!
